## 💻 Project Overview



The Envi Rover is LoRa based, long range, remotely operated robotic system designed to monitor environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, darkness, gas leakage and air quality of disaster zones, agricultural, industrial environments and smart cities. It uses LoRa communication to transmit data wirelessly over long distances without the usage of internet.

## ⚙️ Features
- Real-time environmental data collection  
- Long-range wireless communication using LoRa (SX1278) 
- Remote control and monitoring  
- Low power consumption and cost-effective design  

---

## 🧩 Components Used
- ESP32 (Microcontroller)  
- LoRa SX1278 module  
- DHT22 sensor (Temperature & Humidity)  
- MQ135 sensor (Air Quality)
- LDR sensor 
- Motor driver (Cytron MDD10A)  
- DC Motors and Chassis

## 🔧 Working Principle
The sensors collect environmental data, which is processed by the microcontroller and transmitted through the LoRa module to a remote receiver. The controller side displays the collected data in real-time.

---

## 💻 Code
All source codes are available in the repository (Rover side and Controller side).
